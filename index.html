      "The Lick" is a famous musical phrase often used in jazz improvisation. It
      typically starts on the root note of the current chord or key. While "The
      Lick" can vary slightly depending on context and interpretation, this
      program was written to allow aspiring musicians to play this legendary
      passage simply by pressing a singular key on their keyboard!!!
